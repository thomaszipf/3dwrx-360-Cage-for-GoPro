This is a - easy to print - solution for a VR camera mount.

Its intended to be printed in high quality and does not need any supports. The System is intended to be modular, to be able to mount any cam you need.

Its avoiding any propritrary mounts to avoid license violations and by saying this, its intended to center the camera picture always by specific mount design.

You can insert screws & nuts to the build in order to increase sustainability.
